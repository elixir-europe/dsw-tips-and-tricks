# DSW Tips and tricks
Tips and tricks on Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW) for data stewards.

For step-by-step instructions please consult the [wiki](https://github.com/elixir-europe/dsw-tips-and-tricks/wiki)


# Introduction
This repository is designed for data stewards working with DSW, providing practical guidance for various operational tasks. It complements the official [DSW documentation](https://guide.ds-wizard.org/en/latest/about/introduction/index.html) and addresses specific questions, such as:
* Creating and customizing the MS Word output format of a Document Template.
* Viewing differences between two versions of a Knowledge Model.
* Extracting a detailed list of UUIDs from a Knowledge Model (useful for Document Templates).
* Changing a Knowledge Model’s status from “child” to “sibling”.
* Integration questions
  * how to hack extend it to get more complex information than just web links (URL);
  * how to link these questions to custom json formatted data.

**Important:** some of the described tasks need to be performed outside the DSW environement.
